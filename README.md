Algorithms Analysis & Design

Topics Covered in the repo:
"1. Introduction: Algorithms for accuracy, efficiency (space, time); Algorithms in real world
2. Time Complexity: RAM Model, Loop iterations vs execution time, Growth Functions, best-worst scenario"

"Searching algorithms
1. Binary: Logical explanation on the logarithmic time complexity, fitness/feedback function, finding upper - lower bound
2. Ternary: Concept, Advantages over binary search
3. Balancing between no. of search steps and cost of each step: why quaternary search is not that popular"

"Sorting algorithms
1. Case analysis on N^2 sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion/Selection; # of iterations, # of swaps on best/worst scenario
2. Linear (case specific) time sorting: Count sort, a good example of why nested iterations is not always multiplied for time complexity"

"Sorting contd.
1. NlgN sorting: Merge, Quick (fixed and random pivots)"
Asymptotic Notations: upper, lower, tight bound complexity

"Divide and Conquer (DnC) algorithms
1. Look back to merge, quick sort
2. Max-sum subarray: O(NlgN) [can also be solved in O(N^3), O(N^2), O(N)]"
DnC contd.: Karatsuba multiplication
Time complexity of recursive/DnC algorithms: recursion tree, substitution method, master theorem
BFS: traversal, shortest path on unweighted graph, Bicolorable/Bipartite graph detection, cycle detection (odd or even length)
---

1. DFS: traversal (review), Edge classification, cycle detection
2. What is DAG, Topological ordering, Strongly Connected Components (SCC, Kosaraju's algo)
3. Shortest path algo: What is SSSP and APSP, Dijkstra's algo, Bellman-Ford Algo (Negative-weight edges in play)
4. MST: Kruskal's (+DSU)
5. Greedy: Huffman coding, Interval scheduling (covered in lab before mid)

6. Complexity Class: Constant, Polynomial, Exponential, P-NP
7. Backtracking Algorithms: 8 queen Problem
8. Backtracking Algorithms: 15 puzzle Problem

9. DP-1: Fractional vs 0-1 Knapsack
10. DP-2: LCS, Recurrence relation, Properties: overlapping subprob and opt. substructure"
